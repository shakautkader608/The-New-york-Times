      <h2>What are the Differences between var, let and const keywords in JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        Var can be updated and re-declared into the scope and It can be accessed without initialization as its default
        value is “undefined”.Let can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope and It cannot be accessed
        without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.Const It cannot be updated or re-declared into
        the scope and It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.

      <h2>.forEach(), .map(), .filter() What's the difference?</h2>
      <p>
        .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it
        returns undefined..map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the
        updated elements filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a
        new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.

      <h2>What are the Differences Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise
        syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a
        similar manner, there are certain differences between them.Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding.
        However, they have access to the arguments object of the closest non-arrow parent function. Named and rest
        parameters are heavily relied upon to capture the arguments passed to arrow functions.
